# üß© Member A ‚Äî Phase 1: Setup & Foundations

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Repository Setup
- ‚úÖ Created the GitHub repository: **KAVA--local-digital-presence-tracker**
- Set repository visibility to **Public** (can switch to Private later).
- Added a **basic `README.md`** including:
  - Project overview
  - Tech stack
  - Contributors
  - Project phases
- Added a **`LICENSE`** file (final choice pending team decision ‚Äî MIT vs All Rights Reserved).
- Enabled **branch protection** on the `main` branch to prevent accidental direct commits.
- Will invite collaborators once all GitHub usernames are shared.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Documentation Structure
Created `/docs` folder to store all supporting project documents:
- `Project_Phases.md`
- `Data_Model.md`
- `Feature_Map.md`
- `Tech_Stack.md`
- `Target_Audience.md`
- `MVP_Stack.md`

These markdown files will be converted and organized from the original `.docx` project documents.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Coordination
- Shared GitHub repository link with the team for confirmation of access.  
- Started WhatsApp discussion on which **license** to use:
  - **MIT License:** open-source and free for reuse with attribution.  
  - **All Rights Reserved:** full control retained by the team.  
- Confirmed role distribution:
  - **Member A:** Repository setup, documentation & coordination  
  - **Member B:** Database schema & migrations  
  - **Member C:** Backend (FastAPI setup)  
  - **Member D:** Frontend (Next.js UI)

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Next Step (Transition to Phase 2)
Once repository setup and documentation structure are complete:
- Member A will document the **Phase 2 roadmap** in `/docs/Phase2_Plan.md`.  
- Members B, C, and D can begin their local setups and push initial commits for backend and frontend development.
